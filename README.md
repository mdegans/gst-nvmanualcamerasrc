# gst-nvmanualcamerasrc

This is a fork of nvarguscamerasrc. No effort is being made to maintain
compatability with the original source's properties. It's mostly oriented
towards people who want or need full manual control of capture settings.

Changes from `nvarguscamerasrc`:
* ranges are not supported. In development it's been found this is confusing.
* exposure time is set in frames (exposure in nanoseconds is is gettable through `exposurereal` property)
