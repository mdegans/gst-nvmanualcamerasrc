		gstreamer1.0-plugins-base \
		gstreamer1.0-plugins-good \
		libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \

2) Install "jetson_multimedia_api" package from latest Jetpack release.

3) Download and extract the package "gst-nvarguscamera_src.tbz2" as follow:

	tar -I lbzip2 -xvf gst-nvarguscamera_src.tbz2

3) Run the following commands to build and install "libgstnvarguscamerasrc.so":
	make
	make install
	or
	DEST_DIR=<dir> make install

  Note: "make install" will copy library "libgstnvarguscamerasrc.so"
